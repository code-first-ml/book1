    "Now, let us say that if the coin lands as Heads, we win 1\\$ and we win 0\\$ if the coin lands as Tails. We can associate a function $W$ with the experiment such that W(Heads) = 1 and W(Tails) = 0\n",

    "A random variable is a function mapping the sample space (for example: $\\Omega = \\{H, T\\}$) of an experiment to a measurement space $E = \\{0, 1\\}$. Random variables are represented using capital letters.\n",

The sample space would be the list of all the people in the university and the random variable $T$ would be weight corresponding to that randomly chosen person. The weight of that person would be a continuous scale.\n"
